description: Why scrum writers need to figure it out
---

Plenty of writers in the techcomm industry use Github for their own purposes, like with GitHub pages or team documentation repositories. What’s often overlooked, though, is the usefulness Githubs offers to us as an archaeological tool. Learning even the basics of Git and Github can be the difference between a writer actually getting to practice Agile development with a team, or becoming the last bastion of waterfall in an otherwise Agile environment.

###But I'm just a writer
You might think that direct access to production code isn’t worth much if you aren’t a developer, but I would beg to differ. Without the access, writers are stuck at the bottom of the waterfall, getting pummeled with the downpour while their dev-counterparts move on to more goodness. But what if they developed something illogical without your input? It's already merged, and you're stuck writing about the nonsensical interface you could have had more input on had you dug through some scary looking code for a bit. Git makes it to where high-level programming knowledge isn’t necessary to dig through a codebase and investigate the history of the repos. 

###Real time access to changes
Scrum puts a lot of emphasis on cross-functionality among team members. Using Git takes you into this sort of territory, since it means that you can be responsible for your own text changes. In a small way, you become another developer. And your newfound self-reliance is bound to earn you some brownie points.

Making your own string changes just like updating any text file, once you know what text looks like in your project’s programming language. Plus, taking responsibility for these changes yourself means that you never need to worry about games of telephone regarding what the text should be. Labels in the user interface, error messages, output, etc. use your exact wording and punctuation the first time, and every time, because you’re the one making the edits. You have the power, cool, right?

###Increased transperancy 
It’s often far too easy for changes to slip past even the most attentive writer. A last-minute change goes through the chute too quickly, or a team member doesn’t realize that that small change they made needs to be updated in the documentation.

Directly accessing changes in Github ensures that the team’s writer sees every change that’s made, regardless of whether it was flagged for their attention. Everyone is on the same playing field, which makes discussions and teaching-moments all the more easier.

Checking your team's repo first lets you glean the “easy pickings” information by yourself. When you come to your teammates asking questions, you can come armed with all of the easy answers already in-hand. It’s incredible how exhibiting a little extra technical know-how, and making sure that your questions are as well-informed as possible, can change a conversation.

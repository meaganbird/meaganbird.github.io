I’m a writer. I work on interfaces for products and websites, and if I do my job right, you won’t notice me at all. My identity isn’t important. I’m speaking on behalf of the friendly machine that you are trying to work with.

I’m here to help people know what's next, to guide them, and to ask for information in a non-creepy/unintrusive way, so they’ll find what they need and have an easier time doing that thing they need done. I work with content that’s wrapped in code. I’m a sort of translator. I take database fields and turn them into something meaningful for readers, so they’ll enter structured information back into the system.

I don’t know what the databases know. I can’t see what a specific person puts into the database and I don’t want to. But I do know what fields we’re prompting for and what kinds of things we’re hoping to learn about people using the system. These details include: names, dates, locations, habits, relationships, topics of interest, or payment details.

The systems I work on talk to people with my words. These words and strings show up in forms connected by buttons and links. What is your name? Do you live in California or Texas? What is your credit card number? How did you hear about us? What do you care about? These are all very private bits of information. They are snippets of stories waiting to be strung together or picked apart. And since I can’t see the details, I can only write for the abstract. I write the stories I want the interface to tell, working backwards from everyday human-speak to a language the the database can translate.

It’s hard to write interesting stories when you don’t know the subject or the reader. To make it easier, I often use myself or someone I know to fill in the blanks.
When I think about my trail on my amazon prime membership, I can see the strings tell my own story.

I recently read Thich Nhat Hanh’s [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1846044006?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=1846044006&linkCode=shr&tag=swelcont-20](The Art of Communicating). As he talks about compassion and communicating clearly, he says: 

> When we think, when we speak, when we act, we create — and we are there in our creations. That is the outcome of our being… Our thoughts, speech, and actions are our real continuation.

I love this idea; the decisions that you make as a writer matter, even when your work is fragile or temporary. Language has a rippling effect. A thought bubbles up in the author’s mind, comes out as words, and sparks something in the reader. 

As a word-geek, my heart skipped a beat when Hanh mentions that “communication” and “community” have the same Latin root, communicare, which means to impart, share, or make common.

I think communication is ultimately about caring and showing that you care. Online, it’s also about earning trust from your customers or readers. I don’t know about you, but it’s really hard for me to trust somebody that I can’t see or understand, especially when I don’t feel like they care about me at all (ahem, business blogs, y'all aren't fooling anyone). We have to grapple with the complexity of communicating with strangers that can't see or hear us. The only thing they have to draw conclusions from is our words. 

Hanh outlines four bodhisattva guidelines for gentle, loving speech:

- Tell the truth. Don’t lie or turn the truth upside down.
- Don’t exaggerate.
- Be consistent. This means no double-talk.
- Use peaceful language. Don’t use insulting or violent words, cruel speech, verbal abuse, or condemnation.

The first three fit right into a style guide, with a little editing and elaboration. Hanh discusses technology and its role in our lives while weaving in his own religious values. I definitely recommend reading the book, even if you’re not interested in Buddhist teachings. Maybe a good one to check out from the library?
